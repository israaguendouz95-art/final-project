                            Computer hardware refers to the basic physical components that make up the backbone of modern computing and include everything ranging from the central processing unit that interprets instructions to memory cards and graphics cards. Computer hardware was known to have evolved over the years and shrunk with explosive growth and performance over several decades and is based on the semiconductor technology and the Moore Law that accurately predicted the doubling of the number oftransistors that fit into the microchip every two years. Today's computer hardware is capable of supporting everything ranging from the smartphone that is powered by billions oftransistors to the data centers that drive AI and perform unimaginable operations.

                            Software is the intangible part of computing, including programs and data that are directed at machines for performing complicated tasks. The origin of software began in the 19th century, developed by Ada Lovelace who designed the first computer algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. From punched cards to cloud computing, software has developed into an impressive force for innovation and human progress.

                            A network is a system that connects computers and devices to be able to share information and resources. Examples include LAN, which stands for Local connection; WAN, meaning Wide reach; Wi-Fi, standing for Wireless link; and Internet, short for Global web. Networks started in the 1960s with simple wired connections and developed into complex systems interconnecting millions of devices all over the world. They enable sharing data, communicating online, working in the cloud, and collaborating remotely. By linking up people and technology, at the core of contemporary work, education, and daily life lies the network.

                            Our vision is that all individuals in our generation will
                    be aware of the use of ICT. True Progress cannot be 
                    measured by how well we use social networks or which
                    version of device we own but by how well we understand
                    , how well we are proficient in the digital platforms,
                    tools, and software that govern our world. We aim to
                    cultivate a culture where everyone learns, explores
                    , and embraces these technologies, because in this
                    era, ignorance is no longer about not being able to
                    read and write but about not being able to navigate, 
                    create, and innovate in technology. By bringing digital
                    knowledge and planting it into our youth ,surely then
                    we will be able to develop bright, innovative minds
                     ready to shape a smarter more connected future. Together We
                     will create a world where creativity thrives, driven
                     by a shared vision of a better future for humanity.
