            <h3>LaTeX</h3>
            <P>
                LaTeX is a typesetting system created by Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s. It is designed to produce high-quality printed documents and is commonly found in academia, scientific research, and the publishing industry. LaTex utilises the TeX system created by Donald Knuth. LaTeX's goal is to allow users to concentrate on content rather than formatting, and it automatically formats their documents in a consistent and aesthetically pleasing manner.

                Research papers, theses, mathematical equations, technical reports, and other types of structured documents are examples of documents where LaTeX is frequently used. LaTeX provides multiple options for customising document layouts through the use of commands, environments and packages (e.g., layout, font, reference, graphics). Many commonly used packages, such as amsmath (for mathematical equations) and graphicx (for images), enhance the capabilities of LaTeX. Online services, such as Overleaf, which provide templates, live previews (as PDFs) and autocomplete to users, have made it easier for beginners to get started using LaTeX, while continuing to be a powerful solution for experienced users.

            <P>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is free, open-source code-editing software created in 2015 by Microsoft. VS Code is an extremely popular application among programmers across the globe.
            VS Code supports several languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C++ that allow developers to create websites, software, and data projects.
            VS Code can be used for coding, testing, debugging and deploying code as well as managing projects and working with teams. Among its features are syntax highlighting, IntelliSense for intelligent code suggestions, Git compatibility, and debugging tools; VS Code also allows users to add third-party extensions. Users can also use the command palette to create their own workflow and customize the way they work.
             VS Code's interface is easy to navigate, using sidebars, command palettes, terminals, and live previews to allow users to quickly create new projects, organize existing projects, and stay productive.</P>

            <h3>HTML & CSS & JavaScript</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>HTML:</h4>
                    <p>Tim Berners-Lee introduced HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to help form the actual content layout on the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1991; without HTML, websites wouldn't exist. Using HTML, a web browser is able to display and format various types of text, photographs, hypertext links, audio/video, and interactivity.
                    HTML forms the basis of any site, whether used for a simple personal web page, blog, web app, or full-scale eCommerce. Just a few examples of how HTML structures content and enables users and developers to create and maintain websites are: 
                    creates paragraphs;  creates images;  creates hyperlinks; semantic tags such as 
                    and improve both accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Developers today have access to modern textbook-style HTML editors, e.g., Visual Studio Code, with tools such as live code preview, code highlighting, and auto-suggest for completing code syntax, making coding faster, easier, and less prone to errors. Additionally, a clear understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) is vital for working effectively with HTML content as well as efficiently enhancing the content via CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                    <img src="pics/ht.jpg" alt="office">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>CSS:</h4>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), created way back in 1996, were initially intended to enable web developers to style their websites' content visually using HTML markup. CSS also facilitates the separation of the Presentation layer from the Document Object Model (DOM) within the browser, making it easy to maintain a website's appearance.
                    Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) are used for many purposes including styling rectangular boxes on a page using Horizontal & Vertical Alignment, Typography; Spacing; Color; Animation; Media Queries; Flexbox; Grid; and Responsive Design. Commonly used frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS make creating consistent, modern-looking designs more efficient by allowing developers to focus on code instead of design decisions. Live editing capabilities in tools such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) coupled with Chrome's Developer Tools makes it easier to debug and visually develop complex web pages</p>

                    <h4>JavaScript:</h4>
                    <p>Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in 1995 as a scripting language to create interactive and dynamic functionality on websites. JavaScript is hosted on both the server and the client as it is supported by Honujai and Node.js.
                    JavaScript enables developers to create dynamic web pages through the use of AJAX and Forms, integrate rich-media applications such as Flash or HTML5; produce animations and other graphic effects to make a site visually appealing; support online-to-offline application communication through RESTful services; and create client-side web applications. Structural components include Variables, Functions, Events, and Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). Popular libraries (jQuery) and frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) have been created to speed up development processes, allow for more scalable applications, and provide a means by which an application can be structured to meet future needs. Development Tools (IE for example) aid in the development of JavaScript code through features such as Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Debugging, Integrated Terminal, Extensions, and Previews of live servers.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                <h3>Git</h3>
                <p>In 2005, Linus Torvalds developed Git as a distributed version control system to help software developers manage and collaborate on their source code more effectively. At first, Git was developed to aid in managing the Linux kernel project; however, since then it has grown to become the most popular version control system among all types of software development projects.
                Git provides developers with a way to keep all of the different changes made to their code organized. A developer can create a branch for each new feature being added, allowing them to work on multiple features simultaneously. Once the new feature is complete and tested, it can be merged back into the master codebase using one of the many Git commands: git init, git add, git commit, git branch, git merge, and git clone.Because Git stores a copy of each developer's code locally, it operates quickly and reliably without needing an Internet connection. Git is also the underlying technology for many of the websites used by software developers today, including GitHub and GitLab.</p>

                    <h3>Github</h3>
                    <p>GitHub, founded in 2008, is a hosting service based on the open-source project management system known as Git. In 2018, it became part of Microsoft. The purpose was to create a cloud-based place for individual developers to store their code and work with other developers through collaboration tools.
                    evelopers use GitHub for various ways, including storing their code and collaborating with other developers, managing projects involving multiple developers, hosting open-source software products for download by anyone, contributing back to open-source, and providing a way for many contributors to contribute back to one source, namely the original project’s maintainer.Through its functionality and built-in tools, GitHub allows developers to create a repository, where they can keep repositories of products, submit a “pull request” to another developer for review, use “issues” to track bugs or other problems, create “forks” to start their own variation of a project, and discuss the project through its Discussion feature.Additionally, GitHub provides automation tools called GitHub Actions, for automating various activities of a development team, such as testing for problems through integration builds. GitHub also provides documentation capabilities through “README” files and “Wikis” to help developers, at all levels of experience, collaborate effectively.</p>

            <P>In 2011, GitLab was introduced as the first DevOps platform built on Git. GitLab differs from GitHub by providing both an online version and a local/self-hosted version of the application which allows users to have greater security and control over their own data and systems. Because of this feature set many businesses utilize GitLab to facilitate secure and efficient deployment processes.
            Additionally, GitLab also allows software developers to manage source code, share information with co-workers and interface with the entire process of building software. GitLab's complete technology stack includes repository hosting, merge requests, ticketing (issue tracking), as well as CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous distribution) capabilities. Due to these comprehensive features, GitLab has become a widely accepted platform for software development teams working in both the profession and corporate environments.</P>
